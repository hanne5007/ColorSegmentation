1. 
Run myAlgorithm.py to apply my trained model to predict and display results for centroid, bounding box, distances. 
Put the test images into “./test” subfolder, or change the folder name for test images.
For each test image, the masks and refined masks for detection would appear in a 4-in-1 plot. It might include several restarts, and the masks would appear corresponding times. Then the final image would show up with results marked on it. Results are also shown as printed string in below. 
Resulting images would be saved in local folder with ‘new’+original name. 


2. 
To reproduce my training process, run train.py.
Trained model would be saved in local folder. 


3. 
To reproduce my regression process for distance estimation, run getDistances.py.
